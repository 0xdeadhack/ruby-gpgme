=== 1.0.8 / 2009-09-07

* Follow the ABI changes of GPGME 1.2.

  * Add bindings for gpgme_op_{export,import}_keys_start.
  * GPGME.{decrypt,verify,sign,encrypt} now calls
    gpgme_check_version() before creating a context.
    Fixes Bug#26829 reported by Sam Hall.

* Use Hoe for packaging contributed by Kouhei Sutou.
